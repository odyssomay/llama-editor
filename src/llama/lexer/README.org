This folder contains tools for creating a lexer. 
The lexer will then be used in highlighting (see llama.highlight).

To generate a new lexer (which replaces the old one), simply run 'sh generate.sh'.
generate.sh does the following:

1. the clojure script createcljflex.clj generates clojure.flex from clojure_raw.flex
2. jflex generates a lexer from clojure.flex, called ClojureLexer.java
3. the java file is compiled
4. the resulting .class file is moved to ../src/llama/
