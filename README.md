llama-editor is a (relatively) lightweight editor/IDE for the clojure language.

## Installation

1. Download the [jar](https://github.com/downloads/odyssomay/llama-editor/llama-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar)
2. It might be possible to simply double-click the file. If that doesn't work however, open a terminal,<br/> 
   move to the download directory and enter `java -jar llama-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar`

## Usage

There are mainly two ways to access the features:

1. Through the menu.
2. By right-clicking a project tree.

An exception is code completion, which is activated by pressing `ctrl+space`.
